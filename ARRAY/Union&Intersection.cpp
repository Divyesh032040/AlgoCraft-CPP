/*
arr1[]=[3,4,5,3,5,6] and arr2[]=[3,4,5,6,7,8,8,10] than ans should be: [3,4,5,6,7,8,10]
brute force :
1] take a set dataset and put elements in set via iterate both the arr , only unique element will accept by set so at last , we will take a another temp array and put all elements of set into that temp array and return it
